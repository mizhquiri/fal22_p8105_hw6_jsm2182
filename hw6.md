# Problem 2

*Description of raw data* This dataset overviews demographic and
geographic data for homicide victims across various cities in the United
States. It has `n rows(homicide_rawdf)` rows and `ncols(homicide_rawdf)`
columns.

Steps:

1.  Cleaned the data

2.  Use the glm function for Baltimore

# Problem 3

prediction vs residuals (diff between actual and predicted); there
should be no linearity because it would be a violation of the assumption

you use the model to get the predicted model to get the residual show
rmse

Steps:

1.  Cleaned the data

``` r
birth_cleandf = 
  birth_rawdf %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    malform = as.factor(frace),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace)
  ) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

residual plots have a line going through 0

geom_point (hline)

2.  I propose the following model:

y = b(babysex) + b(smoken) + b(wtgain) + b(smoken) + b(mrace) +
b(malform) + b(wtgain) + error

``` r
fit_mymodel = lm(bwt ~ babysex + smoken + mrace + wtgain, data = birth_cleandf)

fit_no1 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birth_cleandf)

fit_no2 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex, data = birth_cleandf)
```

``` r
fit_no1 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birth_cleandf)

fit_no2 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex, data = birth_cleandf)
```

*Modeling process*

- I selected factors that I recognized from the literature may correlate
  to birth weight, such as maternal smoking status, maternal race, and
  the motherâ€™s weight gain during prenancy. I also added baby sex.

*Plot residuals vs predictors in my model*

- the plotted residuals and predictors indicate no colinearity between
  my models. As such, I am content to proceed with my model.

``` r
birth_cleandf %>%
  add_predictions(fit_mymodel) %>% 
  add_residuals(fit_mymodel) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```

*Identify RMSE*

fit_mymodel = lm(bwt \~ babysex + smoken + mrace + wtgain, data =
birth_cleandf)

fit_no1 = lm(bwt \~ blength + gaweeks, data = birth_cleandf)

fit_no2 = lm(bwt \~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength +
bhead*babysex + blength\*babysex, data = birth_cleandf)

``` r
model_df = 
  crossv_mc(birth_cleandf, 5) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble),
  )


model_df = 
  model_df %>% 
  mutate(
    fit_mymodel = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ babysex + smoken + mrace + wtgain, data = .x)),
    fit_no1 =    map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    fit_no2 = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex, data = .x))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_mymodel = map2_dbl(.x = fit_mymodel, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_no1 =    map2_dbl(.x = fit_no1, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_no2 = map2_dbl(.x = fit_no2, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y))
  )
```

``` r
model_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model",
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

As a result, I can see visually that model \#2 is the better model on
average as it has a lower RMSE. My model has a relatively much higher
RMSE.
